						Our team consists of eight childhood friends that enjoy building various types of organizations-ranging from charity foundations,
						social-app development, to K-beauty entrepreneurship. However, for NFTs, it wasn’t until early 2021 when we really began researching the
						art, blockchain technology, and community in NFT itself. As projects began to grow exponentially worldwide, we questioned the
						industry-“How come Koreans have not recognized the true value of NFTs?” Since then, we dove into this industry.

						Our objective as a team is simple-contribute to the ongoing development NFTs worldwide and introduce valuable NFT projects to Koreans. As
						NFT enthusiasts, we will continuously develop beneficial projects for our global community. Moreover, despite the harsh criticism against
						blockchain technology in Korea, we are here to make a positive impact- a warm NFT ecosystem where art, society, and technology are all
						appreciated.
