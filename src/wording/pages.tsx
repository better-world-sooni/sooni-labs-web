				Intro: (

						Founded in 2021, SOONI Labs is the first Korean NFT-focused company that bridges the gap

						Rather than giving a classic buisness introduction, we would like to share a brief narrative about us, SOONI.

				OurStory: (
					<>
						Our team consists of eight childhood friends that enjoy building various types of 
						organizations-ranging from charity foundations, social-app development, to K-beauty entrepreneurship. 
						However, for NFTs, it wasn’t until early 2021 when we really began researching the art, blockchain technology, and community in NFT itself. 
						As projects began to grow exponentially worldwide, we questioned the industry-“How come Koreans have not recognized the true value of NFTs?” 
						Since then, we dove into this industry. 
					</>
				),
				ourMission: (
					<>
						Our objective as a team is simple-contribute to the ongoing development NFTs worldwide and introduce valuable NFT projects to Koreans.
						As NFT enthusiasts, we will continuously develop beneficial projects for our global community. 
						Moreover, despite the harsh criticism against blockchain technology in Korea, 
						we are here to make a positive impact- a warm NFT ecosystem where art, society, and technology are all appreciated.

							When it comes to cryptocurrency, blockchain, and NFTs, there are certain stereotypes that do hold up in reality. 
							Crypto is often recognized as a “rugpull”, “ponzi scheme”, and a “rich-getting-richer mechanism”. 
							Through practical applications of NFTs, we challenge such stereotypes surrounding digital assets.
